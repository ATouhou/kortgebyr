# Kortgebyr.dk

[Kortgebyr](https://kortgebyr.dk) (*danish: card fee*) is a price comparison website for online payment solutions. The purpose of the site is to make the market for payment solutions more transparent. The project started as an advanced spreadsheet (2010), but in 2012 we moved to JavaScript and bought a domain: [kortgebyr.dk](https://kortgebyr.dk). The project is still very much a work in progress.
